## Overview

This repository provides practical implementations of 21 key agentic design patterns for building intelligent systems. The patterns cover core architectural concepts like orchestration, memory, communication, and safety that are highly relevant to inber's multi-agent design.

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. **Prompt Chaining** (Chapter 1)

  ```python
  # Multiple agents with output_key store results in session state
  parallel_research = ParallelAgent(sub_agents=[...])
  synthesis = SequentialAgent([parallel_research, merger_agent])
  ```
- **inber Applications**: Perfect for our multi-agent spawning and coordination

   agent_b = Agent(
       instruction="Process {research_findings} and create summary",
       input_dependencies=["research_findings"]
   )
   ```

4. **Robust Exception Handling**

## Harness-watch — May 2026: Codex shipping patterns

Three concrete primitives that landed in [openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)
between 2026-04-26 and 2026-05-03. Codex doesn't yet have its own
`docs/comparisons/codex.md`, so the observations live here as cross-cutting
patterns inber could adopt.

### 1. Multi-environment context per turn

[PR 20646](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/20646) (stack: 20669, 20647) —
extends the rendered `environment_context` block so a single turn can carry
multiple selected environments, each with its own id and cwd. The model picks
an environment id, and process tools route via that `environment_id`. Single-
and zero-environment turns still go through the legacy cwd-only render path,
so this is purely additive.

**What inber should consider:** Inber's `forge` already manages isolated git
worktree slots per agent session, but the *current run's* tool execution still
binds to a single cwd. Codex's pattern is the natural next step: surface every
available worktree to the model in one prompt, let it pick, and route the
tool-call to that worktree. This is a small change to inber's tool dispatch —
add an optional `environment_id` parameter to file/exec tools and resolve it
through `forge` — but it unlocks the agent reasoning over multiple
checkouts/branches in one turn without spawning subagents per worktree.

### 2. Self-describing memory extensions

[PR 20602 + 20606](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/20606) — Codex's
memory subsystem now supports pluggable "extensions." Each extension lives
under `memories/extensions/<name>/` and ships an `instructions.md` that tells
the consolidation agent how to read/write that extension's notes. The
write-pipeline seeds the `instructions.md` template the first time it lands.
Extension-specific behavior (an `ad_hoc` extension, a `prune` extension)
lives in dedicated modules under `memories/write/src/extensions/` rather than
a flat helper file.

**What inber should consider:** Inber's `memory-store` is a single uniform
schema (importance, decay, embeddings). Codex is asserting that *different
kinds of memory want different curation rules* — a hard rule, a personal fact,
an ad-hoc working note — and the consolidation agent should be told the rule
by the memory itself, not by hardcoded handlers. This maps cleanly onto
inber's existing memory tagging — a `kind` column plus a per-kind
`instructions.md` lookup would let agents author new memory categories without
shipping new code. Worth a sketch in `docs/memory-extraction-evaluation.md`
alongside the ByteRover comparison.

### 3. Effective config lockfile (export/replay)

[PR 20405](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/20405) — Codex now writes
`<thread_id>.config.lock.toml` at session start, capturing the *resolved*
config after CLI overrides, defaults, feature aliases, model-catalog values,
and prompt setup have all been layered. A later run can load that lockfile,
regenerate the effective config, and fail-early on drift. There's an explicit
"allow_codex_version_mismatch" flag for tolerating binary drift while still
comparing the rest.

**What inber should consider:** Inber's reproducibility story today is
"replay the session log." That doesn't capture the *resolved* state of agent
config, model selection, tool registry, or memory snapshot at the moment of
the run. A config lockfile per session — written by the engine when a run
starts, validated against on replay — would turn "I can't reproduce this
trace" into a structured diff. This composes well with the trajectory-export
work already foreshadowed for evolution loops (see April Zup paper, AHE
paper). Smallest first cut: have `engine/` dump a resolved `agent.lock.json`
into the session directory.

## Harness-watch — May 2026: MCP capability negotiation goes richer

Two independent harnesses landed expansions of the MCP `initialize`
handshake in the last week. Both push the same idea: **the host advertises
non-tool capabilities (UI rendering, user elicitation) during MCP init,
and tool servers light up features against those capabilities.** This is a
shift from MCP being a tool-call transport to being a richer
capability-negotiated channel.

### 1. Goose MCP Apps — host UI capability flows into MCP init, tool results carry replayable payloads

[PR 8623](https://github.com/block/goose/pull/8623) +
[PR 8632](https://github.com/block/goose/pull/8632) (goose). Goose 2 (the
ACP client) declares an MCP-Apps host capability during ACP `initialize`;
`goose serve` stores it per ACP connection; the runtime translates it into
the downstream MCP `initialize` payload as
`capabilities.extensions["io.modelcontextprotocol/ui"] = {mimeTypes:
["text/html;profile=mcp-app"]}`. When an app-capable tool completes, the
runtime reads the `ui://...` resource the tool returns, attaches the
hydrated snapshot to `tool_result.meta.goose.mcpApp`, and forwards it
through `tool_call_update._meta.goose` for both live render and replay.
The payload survives session reload, so reopening an old session
reconstructs the rich tool-result view without re-running the tool. Two
architectural points worth pulling out: (a) host UI capability is an
*ACP-client property*, not a runtime guess from platform — the runtime
stops inferring; (b) the rich payload is *backend-owned and persisted*,
not derived in the UI from raw tool output.

**What inber should consider:** Tool-store MCP servers in inber today
return text/JSON; BridgeUI renders a generic tool result. The Goose
pattern maps cleanly onto inber's three-layer setup: (1) BridgeUI declares
a UI capability shape during dash's MCP init to tool-store; (2) tool-store
MCP servers can return a `ui://session/<id>/...` resource alongside their
text; (3) llm-bridge-server reads the resource at tool-completion time and
attaches it to the canonical message under a stable `_meta` key, so it
flows through the bus → log-store → bridge-ui replay path identically to
plain tool output. The persistence-on-tool-result detail matters: without
it, rich payloads get lost the moment the session reloads, and we end up
re-fetching or losing fidelity. Worth a sketch in
`docs/multi-agent-design.md` or a new `docs/mcp-apps.md` before
prototyping — there is a real chance llmux/dash diverge on how they want
to render `ui://` resources, so the *backend payload contract* should be
nailed down first.

### 2. Codex — MCP elicitation capability adoption

[PR 20562](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/20562) (codex). Codex
moves to the **2025-06-18 MCP elicitation capability shape**, the
spec-blessed channel for an MCP tool to ask the user for input mid-call
(approve a destructive action, pick from N options, supply a missing
field) without the tool inventing its own ad-hoc protocol. Goose 2's MCP
init in PR 8623 above already advertises `elicitation: {}` in its
capability block — i.e., two harnesses converging on the same canonical
spec in the same week.

**What inber should consider:** Inber's permission/guard layer currently
intercepts dangerous tool calls and surfaces them via the existing
permission-prompt flow (HookEvent awaiting_resolution, shipped 2026-05-01
— see `project_permission_prompt_followups`). MCP elicitation is the same
shape one layer down: the *tool itself* asks the user a question through
the host. For tool-store MCP servers, supporting elicitation means
inber's MCP client (in llm-bridge-server) needs to advertise
`elicitation: {}` on init and route incoming elicitation requests through
the same UI surface the permission prompts use. This is a small wire-up
job, not an architecture change — but it should land before tool-store
authors start inventing their own clarification protocols and we end up
with N incompatible flavors.

### Cross-cutting takeaway

The theme is **capability-negotiated MCP**: the host says what it can do
(render UI, ask the user a question, sample from a model) on init, the
tool server tailors its responses to fit, and the resulting payloads
travel as first-class metadata on tool results — replayable, persisted,
and decoupled from any one frontend. Inber's tool-store + bridge-ui +
log-store split is already the right shape for this; the pieces missing
are (a) a richer init handshake on the llm-bridge-server MCP client and
(b) a stable `_meta` slot on canonical tool-result messages so rich
payloads survive the bus → log-store → bridge-ui round trip. Both are
small changes that compose with each other and with the existing
permission-prompt work.

## Harness-watch — 2026-05-09: One tool, one shape (codex apply_patch)

Codex this week collapsed `apply_patch` from two invocation paths to one.
[PR 21651](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/21651) deletes the
function-style (JSON-args) registration of `apply_patch`; [PR
21687](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/21687) flips the freeform/
grammar-constrained variant to default-on. The grammar variant lets the
model emit the patch payload as a natural diff body inside a custom tool
call instead of stuffing it inside a JSON string parameter — the diff
format is the tool-call format.

The design statement is the interesting part, not the diff: **two ways to
invoke the same tool is a contract bug, not a feature.** Both shapes were
maintained for several releases; codex's read of the data is that having
both paths created surface ambiguity for the model (which shape to pick),
the harness (two parsers to keep in sync), and the test corpus (two
trajectory shapes per task). Collapsing to a single canonical shape is a
deliberate tightening, and the choice of the freeform/grammar shape over
the JSON-args shape is itself a vote: when a tool's payload has a
natural format (a unified diff, a SQL query, a shell command), making
that format *be* the tool-call body avoids a layer of escape/quote/
re-parse that the model has to navigate inside its tokens.

**What inber should consider:** Inber's tool surface today is JSON-args
across the board — `Read`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Grep`, etc. Most of those
tools have payloads that are unambiguously JSON-friendly (paths,
patterns, flags). The exception is `Edit`: the `old_string`/`new_string`
parameters are quoted blobs of source code that the model has to escape
into JSON, and that escaping is a known source of "edit didn't apply
because of a stray backslash" failures. Codex's bet is that the patch
shape should be the tool body, not a JSON-encoded string; for inber,
the smallest version of that bet is to add a freeform/diff-body variant
of `Edit` (or a new `ApplyPatch`) that takes a unified diff as the body
and reduces the model's escaping burden. This is a tools-side
experiment, not an architectural one — but it's worth measuring against
inber's existing edit-failure rate before committing.

The cross-cutting principle, worth flagging beyond the apply_patch
specifics: **when a tool has multiple invocation shapes, the harness
owns a contract bug.** Inber's tool registry should pick one shape per
tool and never carry two. If a new shape proves better, the migration
is a one-shot replacement, not an additive co-existence.
